''' This program takes an integer as input and converts it to its equivalent 
in any base from 2 (binary) to 16 (hexadecimal). We impose a limit of 16 
because we don't have a convenient symbol set defined for digits beyond 15.
Hex 15 is 'f'.   

Note that even though the program is longer than the class example, most of the extra effort went on 
error trapping. 

Note also that I have partitioned the work using functions to handle the conversions and the validation 
of the base. As this validation function us invoked by both conversion functionss, this is a sensible approach.
